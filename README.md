## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap
- Sass/SCSS
- CSS 
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- The use of Bootstrap opacity, img-fluid, order-breakpoint-* etc.

- Trickiest was the part where I had to make columns out of the `ul li` elements in both mobile and desktop, stack them in a column in mobile, and in a row for desktop.

- Also, had some trouble aligning the image correctly in desktop, setting `margin:0; padding:0` helped with that.

### Continued development

- To continue with both tutorials and projects for HTML5,CSS3,Javascript,Bootstrap, and Sass/SCSS

### Useful resources

- [Opacity](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/opacity/) - Helpful to add the color effect for the image.
